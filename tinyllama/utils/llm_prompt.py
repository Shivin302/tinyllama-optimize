The Last Signal

In the year 2378, the starship Eryndor drifted through the void of the Orion Arm, a relic of humanity’s ambition to colonize the stars. Its crew of 47 had dwindled to one: Kael Renar, a systems engineer who hadn’t spoken to another soul in 93 days. The ship’s AI, SARA, was his only companion, its voice a synthetic blend of calm and precision that echoed through the empty corridors.

Kael sat in the command bay, his eyes fixed on a flickering holoscreen. The Eryndor’s mission was to establish a relay station on Gliese-581d, a potentially habitable exoplanet. But six months ago, a micrometeoroid storm had shredded the ship’s primary comms array and propulsion systems. The crew, one by one, had succumbed to radiation poisoning from a breached reactor. Kael survived only because he’d been sealed in the shielded engineering bay during the crisis.

“SARA, run the diagnostics again,” Kael said, his voice hoarse from disuse.

“Diagnostics complete,” SARA replied. “Propulsion at 12% capacity. Life support stable for 47 days. Comms array non-functional. No signals detected in 93 days, 14 hours, 22 minutes.”

Kael rubbed his stubbled jaw. The Eryndor was a ghost ship, limping through space with no way to call for help. Earth was 20 light-years away, and the nearest colony, Tau Ceti, was unreachable without faster-than-light comms. He’d repaired what he could, but the ship’s quantum ansible was beyond salvage. His only hope was a faint, intermittent signal SARA had detected weeks ago—a pulse that didn’t match any known human frequency.

“Play the signal again,” Kael said.

A low, rhythmic hum filled the command bay, interspersed with sharp bursts of static. It wasn’t Morse code or any protocol Kael recognized. It felt… alive, like a heartbeat from the void. SARA had triangulated its source to a rogue planetoid, designated XN-47, three days’ travel at current speed.

“Probability of intelligent origin?” Kael asked.

“67.4%,” SARA said. “Spectral analysis suggests a non-human modulation pattern. Recommend investigation.”

Kael hesitated. Diverting to XN-47 would burn precious fuel, and the planetoid’s orbit was unstable, skirting a debris field. But staying on course meant drifting until life support failed. He tapped the console, setting a new trajectory. “Let’s see who’s out there.”

The journey to XN-47 was tense. Kael spent hours recalibrating the ship’s sensors, haunted by memories of his crew—Captain Mira’s steady commands, Dr. Chen’s quiet humor. He pushed the thoughts aside, focusing on the signal’s growing strength. By the time XN-47 appeared on the viewscreen, a jagged, obsidian world against the starfield, the signal was deafening.

“SARA, scan the surface,” Kael said.

“Detecting a structure at coordinates 17.2N, 45.8W. Metallic composition, emitting the signal. No life signs.”

Kael suited up, his EVA gear patched from previous repairs. The Eryndor’s shuttle was barely functional, but it carried him to the planetoid’s surface. He landed near a towering spire, its surface etched with geometric patterns that pulsed with faint blue light. The signal was now a cacophony in his helmet’s comms.

He approached the spire, his boots crunching on"""
